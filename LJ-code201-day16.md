## Learning Journal, Day 16 (Project week day 1)

Today was good if a little boring - most of the learning today wasn't strictly coding related as much as group-dynamic learning. Consciously discussing and deciding on group norms felt like a real good idea and I was more 'into' it than I planned, but my other group members seemed less interested and there were already a couple instances today where those norms were violated (although the most egregious was more due to a technical misunderstanding of git than a purposeful scorning). The wireframes look great, though, and I'm noticing I'm very comfortable introducing and discussing our code, which I hope pays dividends on Friday. Find it a bit personally unexpected that I've been enjoying the organization and planning of code as much as the writing of it, as I've never been an organizer or planner in the rest of my life!

Most of the afternoon when we were all working on the site itself (instead of planning) was spent with data validation and entry so that our values to compare were all set up and able to spit through the constructor. Once that was wired up and confirmed working, I started planning out the logic to get the comparator going, without doing a whole lot of actual coding in atom. Still, we're working together decently well and all have our tasked clearly ID'ed, so I'm ready to hit the ground running at 9 tomorrow.
