## Learning Journal, Code 301, Day 5

So much to do! So much to read! Stumbled at the start of this week as I was finding myself a bit overwhelmed, especially after being as lazy as possible for my break week. Starting to feel back in the 'constant sprints' mindest, and need to be checking canvas more often due to the shift in due date times. There's always administrative work to do!

jQuery was rough at the mid-point of the week. Despite the online tutorials that were repetition-focused and seemed simple enough must not have taken hold as deeply as I'd thought. After a day or so working so intensly with them, they're much more comfortable. Reading from right to left helps with comprehension, too - and to be honest, in-depth reading out loud of code has been great, too. It helps with trying to prevent over-thinking, which I feel like I do a lot at this point.

I like the code wars setup a lot, and should start working in doing non-class ones when I'm bored outside of class.
