## Learning Journal, day 15 (end of week 3)

Ooof, this week was hard. But I've already addressed most of that from Wednesday. Last two days have gone swimmingly - Thursday lab with my pair programming partner was clean and almost entirely painless - I am really on-board with code as a collaborative process. It's quicker, cleaner, and easier. We were done early, and even put some additional styling and user feedback into the site 'cause we could. That was very, very encouraging after my Mon-Wed. I realized I knew more than I recognized, and just needed another head to bounce ideas off of and catch typos and boneheaded errors (calling wrong variables, etc.).

Friday has been good - feels a bit light after the rest of the week. Ready to catch up on reading tomorrow and take the 201 final / 301 entry so I can have Sunday for cleaning up anything in busmall/salmon cookies, although I'll admit that with my grade at the point it should be post-readings submissions, I'll probably be only doing light updates to those projects, as we're already well set for day 1 of project week.

Speaking of! Our fourth group member was out ill today, but the three of us together went to a catacomb room and started discussing products and quickly crystallized around Adrian's "workout suggester", which was the only idea that Sam didn't rule out as a 201 project in the canvas discussion. Even though the concept really didn't appeal to me - I've never been a gym type - both Adrian and Matt seemed to bond on the workout aspect, so I decided to just roll with it. I'm really glad I did, because a real cool thing happened - even though I wasn't interested in the theme at all, I quickly started thinking about how we'd break down the comparison quiz that'll form the core of the JS on our project, grabbed a pen, and started whiteboarding ideas on the glass. Holy shit, I built out all the pseudocode - and some actual code - for how we'd do it! I felt like a "real" developer! Also, the aspect of 'the function for users of this site bores me, but the coding is rad' made me realize how developers could wind up at companies who, frankly, I don't respect for their political positions/corporate governance/overall social impact if the *technical challenges the job provides* are alluring. I know it's a long time (kinda) before I'll be on the job hunt, but it's a notion I'm glad I have a bit more insight on now, and can keep in my mind as I advance in this industry.
