## Learning Journal, Code 301, Day 8

This week is going well. I'm on top of classwork and labs are moving briskly. However, things don't seem to be making any intuitive sense, even after completing labs - I keep feeling like I'm transcribing code more than understanding it. JB tells me this is normal and OK, but I still get hung up on wanting to know the "why" of code/processes (such as how to wire up a web server) when we're really doing a bunch of what/how.

Labs in 201 seemed to involve (or at least strongly benefited from) planning and whiteboarding. Labs so far haven't - it's been "do A", "do B" in the TODOs of starter code. I feel like this doesn't stretch my thinking/learning in the way having to really conceptualize what the problem domain is and how to solve it. But in a way, I guess this is the result of progress - in 201, we were learning the fundamentals of logic, syntax, knowing what methods exist and can do, and putting them together. Now that we're expected to know much of that, we can focus for now on things like building out web servers, which may not require (at this point?) logic or code, but are obviously crucial to understand if we're to be employable.

Still, to play off that idea, I'm still really enjoying the Code Wars challenges, and if I had downtime (what's that!?) I'd be doing them for fun, not just class credit. The challenge today was really interesting after I was done - comparing my answers to others is always enlightening. It seems a lot of people find the 'single line answer' to be some sort of holy grail/best answer, but the one today that solved the challenge in one line was incredibly hard to read, due to its nested logic and really intense regex. Maybe that's partly just because I'm not as familiar with regex, but I gotta say the single-line result felt like showing off more than creating readable code, and I didn't like it for that reason! I also felt like the solution I wrote may not have been the most complex or minimized code, but I also thought there was some cleverness in its simplicity (simple in the sense of using pretty basic methods) and in how readable and easy to follow it was.

Also - god, I really, really need to commit to memory how to search an array in reverse if you're going to be altering the array being searched as you iterate through it! I recall doing some real janky i+2 counter thing with a second x++ counter inside a for loop a week or two ago when I iterated going forward and was popping stuff, in order to read the whole array. That was dumb and shockingly inelegant; just go from the last index backward and count DOWN to i >= 0 and you can pop stuff to your heart's content!
