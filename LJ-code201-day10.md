## Learning jouranl, day 10

The last two days of class felt less productive than the early parts of the week. JS (and its puzzles) is really engaging, even when it's failing, breaking, or being uncooperative. CSS and styling... less so. Not as engaged by the layout and design side of things. Looking forward to the new week and to start fresh, as the projects move so quick and our own code changes so totally so quickly that it gets cluttered and hard to follow by the end of the week, and makes me want to start over entirely. Very curious about what the projects will entail at this level, given our shaky and uneven skill sets - but I'm also excited to be 'let free' a bit to really use the skills I've picked up however we see fit, rather than having it be constrained by lab technical requirements. For now, though, it's saturday night and I am getting a beer. Sam mentioned in lecture on Friday about how often walking away can help - and it certainly felt this week like my best work was right back from lunch, when I'd taken most of a day from working on my own code and was looking at the problem fresh, so I'm gonna take that to heart and try not to think about my cookie stand too much until I work on the CSS tomorrow...
