## Learning Journal, Code 301, Day 18 (project week day 4)

Not a lot to write for today. Project was basically at MVP when I walked in at 9:15 - apparently the route to the Bing API Jeff and I wrote last night but couldn't test due to heroku permission issues was absolutely spot-on perfect and worked on the very first go. I'm bummed I missed out on that moment of success, but since I wrote most of the route I was more thrilled that it worked than anything else. After that, most of what we were doing was bug fixes, styling updates, and the like - not a lot of stretches in our coding, but good practice for how real-world site development works regardless.

I feel real ready to present tomorrow. Practiced my introduction and pitch in my head a bunch while trying to relax and play some pinball after class last night. Looking forward to taking some time off before I start 401 so I can build a couple apps from scratch and cement the last month's knowledge.
