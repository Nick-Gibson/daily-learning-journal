# Hell yeah!

Today was great. Got a good night's sleep, know exactly which bus to catch to comfortably make it in on time, remembered to pack a lunch (this just reminded me I had peanuts in my bag too!), felt real engaged in the lectures even if I didn't speak up much. The box model for CSS made a lot of sense in lecture, but I'm still having failures when I actually start coding in it - things seem to just 'not work'; and I still don't find a ton of inspiration in it.

Meanwhile, when I finally got kinda frustrated with the CSS aspect of today's lab, I moved on to the JS. The first new question - the number guesser - was fairly trivial. The second new question - involving the array - was not, as was expected. I was probably beyond the 'ask for help at 15 minutes' point, but I kept googling and checking the text, because I knew all I needed was something - ANYTHING! - that'd evaluate one outside variable against the contents of an array, and eventually did find .indexOf(), which when plugged into where I thought it needed to go, worked on the first test! It took some other hacking to make the last bit work, and the last alert I wound up just typing out the contents of the array instead of finding some way to have it print it out, which felt lame, but whatever, something tells me that skill will come before too long.

While it all worked out in the end, I do feel a bit like the other students hacking at it and failing and discussing it may have wound up learning more about the underlying functionality/theory of looping, which concerned me a bit, but it's just day 3 and it's still going well, so I'm gonna chalk it up to working well and go relax and zone out for a bit.

Whew!
