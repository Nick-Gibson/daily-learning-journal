## Learning Journal Day 13

*Phew*
Long couple of days. Had my minor breakdown that almost feels expected with the pedagogy here, was more verbose about it in my lab submission than I expected myself to be, regretted it the moment after I hit send, and wound up getting a lot of good feedback from both a couple TAs and instructors. Definitely felt the community love. Also, hit up a knowledgeable classmate about good places to buy memory online (the proximate cause of said breakdown was almost guaranteed to be a lack of memory) and not only did she answer some questions, but also said she'd check some busted laptops when she gets home, so it might even come my way free/on the cheap (I'll trade a decent bottle of whiskey if that's her thing). Not immediately related to code, but feels like important things to remember when I'm feeling overwhelmed and at a loss; ask for help more.

As for the actual classwork, Tuesday was just a total loss. I made some decent progress, then lost it all (lesson learned about AC/P). When I walked away to get a drink and play some pin and came back late in the evening, I tried to basically start over with code from a morning demo, only to learn that, damn, taking in someone else's code - even when you *know it works*, does not mean you can expect to just be able to alter it or tailor it to suit your similar needs and have it either work or - more importantly here - make sense. I stared at it for an hour before I did any typing, as I just didn't understand a thing of what was going on, even though I had written similar code the day before to achieve the same purpose. The conceptualization of programming languages as, well, *languages*, is becoming more clear as I see the truly wide array of responses and approaches to identical problems, just as we can say the same thing an infinite number of ways, depending on one's vocabulary, diction, mood, habits, etc. The creativity is rad and unexpected.

Have more work to do on my lab project, but feel like it's pretty surmountable at this point, and can get the reading for the night knocked out pretty quick, too. No worries today, thank goodness.
