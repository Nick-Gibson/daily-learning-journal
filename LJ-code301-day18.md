## Learning Journal, Code 301, Day 18 (project week day 3)

Today went really well. Maybe the best day of 301 yet. Did some simple work with gmaps static API - wish I'd known about it yesterday instead of losing a whole day of project week to never getting their API to work. Oh well. Got it to render, don't care. But even better - in the afternoon, when I didn't have a lot to do, I realized Jeff was having problems with getting the images API to work, so we pair programmed, I navigated, and basically dictated a route from scratch - routes have SUCKED and they just haven't made any sense, but I felt so, so much more confident after that experience. We had issues getting our push to deploy on Heroku, but Thursday morning (whoops I'm writing this the next day, sorry, spoiler alert) when we had Catherine change some permissions (as she created the project there), the changes were pushed and the code worked WITHOUT ANY EDITS NEEDED. We wrote the front and back end of the route without being able to test it, and it worked on the very first go. That was GREAT. Our project's coming together real, real nicely, which is huge given how demoralized we seemed to be as a group at the end of Tuesday.

I'm so ready to present this muthaf'er and am actually, again, just like 201, surprisingly proud of the result!
