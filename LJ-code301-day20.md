## Learning Journal, Code 301, Day 20! (project week day 5; final class)

So that was 301, eh? I don't really know how much energy I have to write here, saturday morning, feeling like I'm now done with the course. Oh well! Our presentations went well. We didn't have any real issues and our site was ready to go walking in this morning, so we all (my group) had a pretty chill day of watching presentations and eating and not letting the nerves get to us. I felt like our presentation went smoothly; couldn't help but notice a couple of the species that were picked randomly during our presentation were excellent choices - I was worried we'd get a bunch of 'least concern' or 'data deficient' selections as soon as we had an audience, but the app did us a solid and displayed a bunch of endangered, photogenic animals. Questions were easy enough to handle.

I was planning on jumping straight into 401, but I still feel like I had too many instances in this last month of being 'drug along' rather than leading on projects and assignments, and I want to take some time to give myself a break and also have an opportunity to maybe just work a boring temp job during the day for a month and build an app of my own from start-to-finish to prove I know all the things I'm supposed to. I've been quietly brainstorming about things I could do with APIs I've seen, so we'll see what comes about.
