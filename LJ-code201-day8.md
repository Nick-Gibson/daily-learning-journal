## Day 8 Learning journals

Technically, it's day 9, as I went to the soccer match last night and left my gear overnight at CF so I could have a bit of fun, but had to wake up extra early to come in as a result. Beyond code, I'm pretty surprised I've adjusted to this schedule and have been as generally responsible as I have the last few weeks. Even went to a bar in Belltown after the match last night *only to play pinball*, I didn't even have a lousy Rainier. Who am I!? Anyway...

This week has been hard, but good. Stayed way too late on Tuesday working on the object constructor lab. Most of the time was spent dealing with small typos. Am really having it hammered in how important dealing with typos is; I probably lost 2+ hours to two small things, but moreso, those two hours held the most frustration I've dealt with so far. I wanted to cry out of exasperation, and when the second typo was finally pointed out, I'd commented out so much of my code to find the problem that I couldn't even remember what I'd been doing beforehand. When a classmate helped me out and I saw what a minor issue it was (passing a string, not a variable), I was more frustrated than relieved. And then, as keeps happening, I typed one more line of code... and looked up two hours later having lost all track of time trying to get some rendering to work. This is a skill I can already find myself getting lost in.

Wednesday was a much, much easier day - my whiteboarding is going really well, and I'm being very diligent about 'defining the problem domain' and making sure I know what I want to do before I type out any code. I was largely able to follow a step-by-step list to get my form working, and didn't have much twisting in the wind at all - excepting for the very last piece of the puzzle, which I'm pretty sure I can fix quickly now after stepping away for awhile. I got the form to work quickly and without fuss, but if I'm honest, I was transcribing a lot of the lecture's code without understanding it - the whole event.x.y.z notation is fuzzy. I saw it work, but I don't know how or why. I have a sense being ok with things "just working" without the "how" or "why" is going to be a stretch goal for me - I like understanding systems from a high, conceptual level down, but that just may not be possible here, at least for a long time and after a lot of effort. Still, things feel good, and I'm enjoying code a lot more than I thought I would.
