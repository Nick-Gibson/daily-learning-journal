## Learning Journal, Code 301, Day 16 (end of classes/start of project week)

So much to do. Much better at planning out apps and building to-do lists of small code items, still not a lot better at actually coding them. Spent all afternoon trying to get google maps to simply load up based on a passed in set of values (lat, long), got real close to getting it to work, wound up ten minutes ago at 6:30pm just nuking everything I'd done. BUT I don't see that as a terrible thing - I learned a lot about how to get gMaps to work, and I think I'm close to a solution, AND I think my problems earlier today was more because of not knowing where in the docs to get the syntax I needed, maybe moreso than a technical challenge. Essentially, I have to remember when to step back and ask whether I'm trying to solve the right problem, or if there's a better/easier way to do things.

So much to do.
