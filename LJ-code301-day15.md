## Learning Journal, Code 301, Day 15 (end of classes/start of project week)

Stretched a lot today. Finally felt like I saw how routes really connect together (and, I think as crucial to my understanding, how they _don't_ always connect back-and-forth to each other). 'Endpoints' more clear as a concept. Chaining steps to debug also making a ton more sense, although less hands-on experience with it than I'd like going into next week. Should look into seeing if the group debugging lectures came out, because I was distracted too much by my own code. Plus, I discovered when sick that watching them on my tv is surprisingly easy and I think it fits with my ADD better, anyways, hah.

Am starting to foresee how jQuery styling methods could look really, really slick for our project. Sketched some wireframes that actually look pretty and feel like they express a design style, and that excites me after all the dismissal/disinterest I've had with styling as a CSS exercise in previous weeks. Maybe I do like the design side just fine, once I know more of what's possible.
