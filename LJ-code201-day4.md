## day 4

*Whelp, thought we were doing daily journals - so there's a bonus "day3" entry in my directory. Good to do the writing anyway - my background in political theory means I tend to be verbose - sorry to my graders if these go long...*

Today was good - this feels a bit like settling in now. More used to the flow of the schedule, both in and out of class, and am finding myself in the mindset of making smart-ish choices outside of class so that class goes well (can't believe I didn't get off my bus early last night to stop at Olaf's for a few practice pin rounds).

Coursework is going well, but finding time to get through the entirety of the readings is the most challenging bit so far. Happy to stay late and code, but keeping focus on the books last night in bed after being in the building all day made my brain fight back and need a break. Gonna have to go back and re-read plenty of stuff this weekend - but if I'm largely on top of everything else, that feels acceptable.

Finding that I'm still new enough to the JS that one of the most frustrating aspects is writing pseudocode that feels like a valid approach, but having no idea what calls or keywords, etc. to use to actually execute. Spent toooons of time yesterday searching google and reading the book's index to find .indexOf() to search within the array I'd created. I knew the code existed and I could do what I had in my mind, I just didn't have the phrasing yet. This lack of 'having the phrasing' has also made a lot of the first time a classmate makes a code block work seem like a 'trick' more than a 'technique', as it's been hard to follow along in any real respect until after the whole idea is fleshed out and I'm able to review finished product.

Still need to spend more time with CSS. Got so caught up with JS today that we didn't do anything with it. So my weekend catch-up goals are going back over the reading (and getting ahead on next week's?) while putting the CSS chapters into practice on my own project a bit to try to reinforce the reading.
