#### Learning Journal, day 18 (Project week day three)

All goes well. No big breakthroughs in learning/coding/etc. today; just a lot of breaking down problems, sharing them with the group, and picking the ones that work best for us to fix. Slow and steady wins the race. The group is pretty chill and drama-free, so we're all just doing our thing and trying to get this site done.

Still need to get better at CSS. May need to take time during the off-week and build a quick site or two (I have a few joke ideas in the back of my mind) just to have to do all the styling from start to finish.
