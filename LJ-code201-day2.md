# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

#observations
I like JS! Skills/ability to 'do work' feels super limited at this point, but the basic structure makes sense so far and I'm excited to get to more powerful uses of it. HTML is clear, if uninspiring, and I admit a bit of boredom with CSS at this point. I'm more of a writer and 'analytical' type (for lack of a better phrasing) and it feels a bit like visual arts that I've never been as inspired to create personally.

#problems
I'm so tired still. So tired. Adjusting to these hours sucks. I am the uncommon person who enjoys and learns well from lectures, but having them at 9am when my body is still pretty used to just having gone to bed, rather than having just woken up and needing to be alert, is rough.

#goals
I like theory - that's not new - and find myself pretty drawn to 'bigger picture' aspects of coding - syntax, best practices, terminology, keywords, methods - so that I can convince myself I can do the 'small stuff' of actual nuts and bolts coding. I don't trust myself until I can cogently describe the big picture, so I'm hoping that I can find a way to continue to get comfortable with the broader aspects of development and feel confident to do more advanced work.
