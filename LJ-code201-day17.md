## Learning Journal, day 17 (Project week day two)

Honestly don't feel like there's a ton here to add. Day two of projects are going well, even if I'm a bit overly-tired and thus lost focus in the afternoon. Morning was full of clearly-defined goals for my code, which went off largely without a hitch, afternoon had a few more hitches, but I finally feel like I got localStorage to work as intended, finally, and the code feels nearly entirely done and ready for presenting to my group partners first-thing Wednesday. Then it'll be time for CSS, which I'm still not enjoying, even if I broadly feel like I'm understanding it. Glad I can mostly have it be adjusting previous work by a group member for the other pages, because I'd be at quite a loss to do all of this styling from scratch within the necessary timeframe. Learn by working with other's code, though! That part really does work.

Javascript is still my jam, and I want and hope to know it more deeply and powerfully.
