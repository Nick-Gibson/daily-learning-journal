## Learning Journal, Code 301, Day 11

Not a ton to report. There's so much to keep track of, and while I feel like conceptually a lot of things are clicking, I recognize I don't have a lot of actual hands-on-keyboard experience right now, and that's holding me back. I wish I had more time to breathe and reflect on what I've learned and just.... poke around in a sandbox with what I've learned, but I don't have the downtime to do so - there's always another assignment! Hoping that with the next two weeks plus break time, I can get to a point where everything from 301 makes "sense" and is stuff I can do from scratch before 401... but we'll see.

The Code Wars challenges remain really entertaining, and are probably my best route for confidence, as they require using what we've learned, from scratch, to fix an issue, and I keep getting them completed relatively easily - and I'm even seeing a personal style in code developing. Simple, simple, simple!

This week goes well so far, though.
