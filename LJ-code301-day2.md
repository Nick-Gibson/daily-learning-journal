#### 301 Learning Journal, day 2

Today was a lesson in not being frustrated - walked in already feeling behind, as day 1 lab time felt rather wasted and the instructions for the SMACSS mini-lab were unclear on *when* the project was done, and unclear on moving on code wars, which, by my reading, seemed to be a stretch goal for the morning, not a discreet, graded assignment. Perhaps the SMACSS lab should be listed as the *third* thing to do on the morning of day 1...

So I walked in with my day 1 CW challenge undone, and my day 2 challenge hamstringed by a misunderstanding of CW - namely, that the "sample tests" are not necessarily all the use cases our code will be tested against. The code I wrote last night worked for Upper Case Letters, and the "sample test" succeeded, but the "final submission" never went through because my code wouldn't pass the further tests I didn't know I needed to code for, and it felt like an error with CW itself, not my code...

I wanted to walk in and start with the lab, but my partner kept working on his own CW submissions, so we didn't start until 11am, at which point the instructions for the new lab formats were both dense and somewhat unclear so that we didn't realize the amount of CSS work entailed - when searching through the HTML for the "TODO" items, we thought this was all there was to do, as the readme directs you to the TODOs a bit early and I literaelly thought we were missing a css file as part of our sample code! My partner was readily distracted by rabbit-holes and I found myself frustrated that we only truly started working on the learning goals of the day by 1pm when he came back from lunch, and that despite repeatedly, vocally trying to push us to work on the responsive elements of the page, he kept searching and working on the more basic css. By 1:50 we hardly had anything, I was frustrated, I knew we didn't have any of the additional files or 'housekeeping' that seems to be a substantial part of the new lab submissions, so I walked away to nuke my lunch before labs rather than submit the lab on time, since it was basically broken anyway.

I'm happy to be cutting my losses for the day, finishing my other canvas items, and moving on to tomorrow. I'll learn more of the responsive css things in the coming labs and hope that the directions become a bit more clear upon repetition, and the administrative aspects of setting up for labs becomes easier with practice. Didn't learn a lot today.
