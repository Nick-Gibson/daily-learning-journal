#### Learning Journal, day 20 (Project week day five) - Final day!

Today was the only day I didn't code a thing, and that was ok. Learning when a project is finished - when more bug fixes are counter-productive, when one more feature is actually derailing - was probably the best thing to take away from today. We practiced our presentation and I felt like it went really smoothly.

Seeing Sam put up one of our week 1 projects on the projector after we had finished was really powerful - I really have learned a lot, and not really given myself credit for it. I kept feeling like I wasn't helping my group enough, that I could have done more - but damn, we did a lot! Looking forward to getting through my working weekend and then having a few days to just... stare off into space. My brain needs the break. On to 301!
