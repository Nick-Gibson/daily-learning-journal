## Learning Journal, Code 301, Day 5 (Monday week 2)

This was a good monday! It was very helpful to have a solo CSS project from scratch, as I still feel shaky on it in general, but I also finished it relatively early even after (tbh) fooling around online a ton in between bursts of coding. So apparently I'm not _terrible_ at it, I just seem to do better at it when I start from scratch and have the 'big picture' of a page.

I had a super slow weekend and got caught up on a lot of things. Week 1 was rocky after being in a 'whatever' kind of mindset left over from the break week. Being mostly caught up (still have a backlog of readings but I can get through them) makes a huge difference; last week I felt like I wasn't actually 'understanding' any of the work I did and it was really stressful. This week it feels like everything is making sense, and so I don't have a monkey on my back, and it's cascading to more successes.

AJAX doesn't actually throw me that much. I guess the internetworking aspect of it isn't that foreign to me? I'm sure it'll get harder soon, but the theory is solid.
