#### Learning Journal, day 19 (Project week day four)

Another day where we kept our heads down and cranked out product. Little to report, which feels like a bit of a noteworthy thing itself, as we were able to plan out the last few features, code them, test them, debug and deploy them without outside help. Noticed I'm pretty comfortable at this point with searching MDN/Stack Overflow for new methods and integrating them into the codebase. Still so, so many features to learn!

Got the site deployed so it's live on the interwebnets. Managed to do that at, like, 11pm after a few rounds at the pinball bar down the street from home. Good to know I can go live while tipsy, but I wouldn't recommend it. Was constantly afraid I was gonna broke something of my team's and not know how to explain what I'd done, hah!

Presentation feels intimidating as I'm not as confidant about my teammates skills in public speaking as I'd like, and getting them to practice feels like pulling teeth. I'm proud of what we've accomplished and the hard work, and am going to be bummed if we wind up looking like amatuers because of the last ten minutes of this very long week. Still, I know my part, and I'll trust in positive thinking to get me through it...
